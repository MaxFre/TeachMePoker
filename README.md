# TeachMePoker
Year One project

Uses javaFx. My part are the Ai and the hand-class. Basically my job was to create a way for the 
computer to calculate how good their hand is and make a good decision for the computer so the user
feel like they actually are playing against a real player. Also i did the help-class that allowes the 
User get help on what he can and cant do. And give them a basic idea on how good their hand is and to 
Highligh the cards if they have or not have a pair/straight/flush etc etc.
