Round1:
Each player has 
Player 1: 8
Player 2: 16
Player 3: 24
Player 4: 30

Player 1 bets 2: -> CurrentMaxBet = 2, totalpotsize = 2
Player 2 All-ins: 16. -> currentMaxBet = 16, totalpotSize 18.
Stuff happens:
Player 3 All-ins: 24. -> currentMaxBet = 24, totalpotSize 42.
Stuff happens:
Player 4 All-ins: 30, totalpotsize 72.
Stuff happens:
